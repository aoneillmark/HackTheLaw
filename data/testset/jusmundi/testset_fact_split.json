    "fact": "This arbitration case, CMC v. Mozambique, arose from a road rehabilitation project (Lot 3) in Mozambique undertaken by Italian construction companies (CMC), financed by the European Development Fund (EDF). After completing the work in 2007, CMC sought additional compensation. The project engineer initially awarded EUR 2.4 million in May 2009. Mozambique's national roads administration (ANE) subsequently offered EUR 8.2 million in October 2009 to settle all claims. CMC responded in November 2009, agreeing to the amount but 'clarifying' that it was *additional* to the EUR 2.4 million already certified. Mozambique viewed this as a counteroffer and denied that a binding settlement agreement was ever reached. CMC initiated ICSID arbitration in 2017, alleging that Mozambique breached the Italy-Mozambique Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) by failing to honor the alleged settlement agreement and through other conduct. The Tribunal found that no binding settlement agreement was concluded between the parties. While the Tribunal asserted jurisdiction over the BIT claims, it ultimately dismissed all of CMC's claims on the merits. The costs of the arbitration were ordered to be borne equally by both parties, with each party bearing its own legal expenses.",

    "fact": "Bank Melli Iran and Bank Saderat Iran (Claimants), Iranian state-owned banks, established Future Bank in Bahrain in 2004. The dispute arose from the Central Bank of Bahrain's (CBB) decision on April 30, 2015, to place Future Bank under forced administration, followed by a resolution to liquidate it on December 22, 2016. The Claimants alleged that Bahrain expropriated their investment without justification, due process, fairness, proportionality, or compensation, in violation of the bilateral investment treaty (BIT). Bahrain denied the claims, asserting that Future Bank engaged in systemic illegal activities, including sanctions violations, money laundering, wire stripping, and misrepresentation, which rendered the claims inadmissible. The Tribunal found that while some violations by Future Bank were established, they were not severe enough to bar the claims. The Tribunal concluded that Bahrain's measures were not a bona fide regulatory response but were politically motivated, disproportionate, and lacked contemporaneous justification, thus constituting an unlawful indirect expropriation.",
